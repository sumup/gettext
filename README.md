Erlang Gettext tools for multi-lingual capabilities.

The gettext application makes it possible to internationalize your Erlang
application. The name gettext comes from the GNU package with the same name.
However, the only thing they have in common is the format of the PO-files,
i.e, the files containing the text that can be translated.

Using gettext you can create an initial PO-file containing all the strings
of your application that should be possible to translate. By translating the
strings into some other language and loading the new PO-file into the
gettext database you can adapt your application for different languages.
